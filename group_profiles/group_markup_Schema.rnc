# 1. Specifying the label/company in the company element
# 2. Acting as a reference for compMent whenever a company is mentioned (like in bgInfo)

# nkBirthName stands for "not korean Birth Name"

# Example for how to use these elemements together:
# Mark (NCT) --> He's Canadian with a foreign birth name (Mark) and a Korean name (Minhyung)
