            <div class="discussion">
                <p>We thought these two charts would be interesting to display side-by-side as we were curious if a larger and more diverse discography in any way correlated to an increase in popularity -- it doesn't seem to! Fascinatingly enough, we stumbled upon a new comparison: the dramatic spread in popularity and recognition among our 10 groups internationally vs. in South Korea.</p>

            <h3 id="line_dis_charts_section">Line Distribution</h3>
            <div class="discussion">
                <p>Line distribution is the amount of lines any given member of a group gets to sing/rap on a track, typically in comparison to the other members. We found this relevant to include, because line distribution is an <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2020/10/just-how-important-and-unfair-is-line-distribution-in-k-pop">incredibly common talking-point within the K-Pop community</a>. We calculated the total line count for each member (and of the song as a whole) through adding full lines and <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad-libs">ad-libs</a> together.</p>
                <p>Doing this happened to create some interesting situations! For example, one member of Stray Kids, <a href="profiles/Stray_Kids_Profile.html#Felix">Felix</a>, got less <i>full lines</i> than most of the other members in their song <a href="songs/Stray_Kids_Back_Door.html">Back Door</a>, but ended up with the <a href="#Stray_Kids_Lines">highest line count</a> due to his increased amount of <i>ad-libs</i> throughout the track.</p>

            <h3 id="verse_chorus_charts_section">Number of Verses and Choruses in Each Song</h3>
            <div class="discussion">
                <p>Next, we wanted to compare the number of verses and choruses of each song side-by-side. You can see very little variance between songs (other than <a href="profiles/GOT7_Profile.HTML">GOT7</a>'s <a href="songs/GOT7_Lullaby.html">Lullaby</a> having slightly more verses than the rest), but this was rather expected. The reason behind showing you this regularity is to point out the immense forumlaic nature of K-Pop music. It's all constructed the same way, every song is built on a borderline indentical foundation. Even when the songs have wildly different styles and explore such different genres, they all share the same core structure, which is what gives K-Pop its specific, recognizable "sound."</p>

            <h3 id="roles_charts_section">Comparing Roles</h3>
            <div class="discussion">
                <p>Finally, we decided to compare the amount of roles taken by the members of two <i>very</i> different groups. For anyone unaware, "roles" are their duties a member has within a group, e.g. they sing, they dance, the write/produce the music, etc. It's important to note that one member can fulfill multiple roles within a group, and these graphs are counting <b>all of that</b> -- for example, if a member is both a rapper and dancer, the graph will count that as one rapper and one dancer. We did it that way so that idols who are prolific and well-known in multiple roles won't get miscounted (take <a href="profiles/BTS_Profile.html#RM">RM from BTS</a> as an example, his main role is "leader," but he is also a key rapper for the group).</p>
                <p>These two charts are looking at two groups who focus on extremely different sounds/styles/aesthetics. <a href="profiles/Twice_Profile.HTML">Twice</a> is mostly an aesthetic group with a lesser focus on vocals and dancing. They don't produce any of their own music. Contrast this with <a href="profiles/Stray_Kids_Profile.html">Stray Kids</a>, who are a rap/dance focused group with three producers.</p>
